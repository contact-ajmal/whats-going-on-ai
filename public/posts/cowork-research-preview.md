# Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work

When Anthropic released **Claude Code**, developers quickly began using it for almost everything else. This prompted the creation of **Cowork**: a simpler way for anyone—not just developers—to work with Claude in the very same way. 

Cowork is available today as a **research preview** for Claude Max subscribers on the [macOS app](https://claude.com/download).

## How is Cowork different?

In a regular conversation, you chat with Claude. In **Cowork**, you give Claude access to a folder of your choosing on your computer. Claude can then **read, edit, or create files** in that folder. 

It can, for example:
- 📂 **Re-organize your downloads** by sorting and renaming files
- 📊 **Create a spreadsheet** from a pile of expense screenshots
- 📝 **Draft a report** from your scattered notes

## Agency and Capabilities

In Cowork, Claude completes work with much more **agency**. Once you set a task, Claude makes a plan and steadily completes it, looping you in on its progress. It's built on the same foundations as Claude Code, meaning it can handle complex multi-step tasks.

When you've mastered the basics, Cowork becomes even more powerful:
- **Connectors**: Link Claude to external information
- **Skills**: Improve Claude's ability to create documents and presentations
- **Browser Access**: Pair with Claude in Chrome to complete web-based tasks

## Seamless Workflow

Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible.
- **No manual context**: You don't need to paste everything in.
- **Async work**: Queue up tasks and let Claude work in parallel.
- **Collaboration**: It feels less like a chat bot and more like leaving messages for a coworker.

## Stay in control

You choose which folders and connectors Claude can see. Claude won't read or edit anything without explicit access, and it will ask before taking significant actions.

> **Note**: Be aware that giving an agent file access carries responsibility. Always provide clear guidance to avoid unintended changes (like deleting files).

## Looking forward

This is a research preview released early to learn from user usage. Anthropic plans to add **cross-device sync** and **Windows support** in the future.

Claude Max subscribers can try Cowork now by downloading the [macOS app](https://claude.com/download) and clicking on "Cowork" in the sidebar.
